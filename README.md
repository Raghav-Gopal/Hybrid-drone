This is a paused project of a drone which is capable of land and aerial commute. In the land mode, it folds its propellers in minimizing its footprint . 
It uses 4 BLDC motors for the propellers and two DC motors for terrestrial travel and 1 servo motor for the folding mechanism.
This project was part of the course mechatronics.
